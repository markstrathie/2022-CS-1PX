    "# CS1PX Semester 2021/2022 - Assessed Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worth 20% of course grade\n",
    "- Released before March 1st\n",
    "- Due: 25th March\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "For this assignment, you will find a public dataset that you find interesting and produce Python code that reads in this data, stores it in a custom data structure, aggregates and subsets the data, and plots characteristics of the data using `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should read through the specifics of the assignment requirements *before* choosing your dataset to make sure you choose one that allows you to complete all the parts of this assignment.  For example, you will need something that allows the kinds of plot required.  If you don't know where to start looking for data, you could start with public datasets on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets, https://data.gov.uk/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with a dataset and there are a small number of lines that contain strings you cannot parse using the techniques we've used in CS1PX (e.g. they have commas in the middle of values) then you should adapt your code to ignore these lines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked on your code (including style and error-checking), as well as your text describing what you have done and the coding choices you have made. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifics of tasks and mark breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "You should:\n",
    "- choose a public dataset that is in .csv format \n",
    "    - If you find a dataset that is in, for example Excel format, it is fine to manually 'export' that to csv, and use that\n",
    "- complete each of the following tasks\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Total marks possible: 75 marks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Task A: Dataset and data structure ***(total 15 marks)***\n",
    "1. describe your dataset in words, saying where you got it and what each of the columns means\n",
    "    - **[4 marks]**\n",
    "2. design a data structure to hold the information in your dataset, and justify your choice of data structure. Include an Python example of your data structure on a small example of your data. \n",
    "    - **[7 marks]**\n",
    "3. describe two other options for possible data structures, and say why they are not as good as the one that you chose\n",
    "    - **[4 marks]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional notes on your data structure choice: If you chose a dataset with a very large number of columns you may want to disregard some of them.  In this case, you may discard some before you process the data in Python, then explain in the Task 1A where you got the data, why you kept the columns you did, and which columns you discarded.  You then don't need to explain the contents of the columns you have discarded. \n"

    "1. I got my dataset from kaggle.com. It is on Suicide Rates Worldwide which is an important topic, especially in relation to COVID-19. The first column is which country the data is from. The second is which year it is from. The next 3 columns are on probability of death between ages of 30 - 70, from common causes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. These are in percent. This will be used as a loose benchmark for how developed a country is in relation to its healthcare, to give context to the following suicide rates. There are 3 columns because one is for Males, one if for Females, and one is average of both sexes. This is usual to draw conclusions based on sex. The next 3 columns are organised similarly - Both sexes, Male, Female. This data is the Suicide mortality rate per 100,000 of the country's population. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data structure will be a dictionary with 3 layers - country, then year, which contains data specific to that year in the country. dataDictionary = {country: {year: {label: data}}}. This will make it easier to filter by country. It would also be easy to group countries together into continents. The data can also be filtered by year relatively easily as well. Here's an example of the data structure with 2 countries:\n",
